**Community Rules**
*We give the benefit of the doubt...  Don't be a dumbass and you'll be fine.

__**Don't be a dick..**__
People can be dumb, we know this. We will deal with the problem swiftly. Do not antagonize.
__**Act like an adult…**__
You are NOT more important than your neighbor…  Community is 18+
__**Racism is ZERO TOLERANCE**__
Period.  You want your opinion, cool.. Keep it to PM’s and out of public discord.
__**Harassment is ZERO TOLERANCE**__
There is a difference between talking shit as friends and attacking someone… you should know it. If you don’t, we will help make it clear.
__**Excessive Bashing is ZERO TOLERANCE**__
Whether it's our group, or another community - don't bash them or their staff. Not cool and we do not support it.
__**Trolling**__
If you're making off-topic comments, taking threads off-topic, or posting random irrelevant material, you're likely to find a boot in your ass.
__**NSFW Material**__
Not allowed in public areas of discord, sorry. 
We do have a members only NSFW channel.  This is NOT public by design.  
__**Community Promotions**__
The community has approved partner communities. If they are not on the approved list don't share it. Partner list will be available with command !partners very soon.
