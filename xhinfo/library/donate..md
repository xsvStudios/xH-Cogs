**Community Donations**
Community Donations are appreciated but **not** required!  Occasionally we will self host gameservers that have a operating cost.  To maintain these servers we utilize the community donations when nessacary.

__Donations Policy__
Do you host a server under the community name?  Sweet ! We know that most of the cost comes out of your own wallet!  We don't want to control that.  However the moment you list for donations we require a few things to make sure our community name is not abused.  All donations must be reported to the Council monthy.  We only ask that all funds recieved in the form of donations be utilized specifically for its purpose.  Any donations that exceeds your requirements must be then put into the Community Donations Fund.  

__Accountability__
Donations are a very overlooked item.  Most poeple don't look into how this is used.  We disagree with this concept as we have witnessed members stealing donations for personal gain.  All money should in which anyone donates to group is required to be 100% accounted for.  
The one thing we strive to do is make sure our books are open.  All donations recieved are added to a community fund controlled by the **Council**. 
Any withdrawl from donations requires community approval.  Community meetings are hosted once a month to review the accounts as to eliminate any abuse.

__Donor Perks__
We offer some sweet ass perks from monthly donors for a little as $5 a month.
